## How to Submit a New Style

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch.
2. Add a new directory under `styles/<slug>/`.
3. Add exactly one `style.json` file and two preview images.
4. Run the validation command.
5. Open a pull request with a short description of the visual system and sample use cases.

## Style Slug Naming

- Use lowercase English kebab-case.
- Keep the slug descriptive and no longer than 60 characters.
- Prefer concrete style words over generic labels.
- Match the folder name, `style_slug`, and copy-prompt filename.

## style.json Requirements

Each public style must include these fields:

- `prompt_template`
- `environment_variables`
- `examples`
- `style_fidelity_anchors`
- `source_content_to_avoid`
- `negative_prompt`

The template should preserve the reusable visual system while requiring new subject matter, text, and scene values.

## Preview Image Requirements

- Filenames must be exactly `preview-16x9.jpg` and `preview-9x16.jpg`.
- Recommended minimum resolution: 1280x720 for 16:9 and 720x1280 for 9:16.
- Use JPG format, preferably under 1MB and always under 5MB.
- Avoid visible watermarks, platform UI, QR codes, account handles, or brand-owned marks.

## Validation

Run this command from the repository root before submitting:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate-style-json.py .
```

## What Not to Include

Do not include original reference images, watermarks, platform identifiers, QR codes, account information, private prompts, or unauthorized brand assets.
